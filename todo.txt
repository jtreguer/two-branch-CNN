This implementation includes:

    Two branches:

        HSI branch with 3 convolutional layers (1D convolutions) processing the spectral information

        MSI branch with 3 convolutional layers (2D convolutions) processing spatial information

    Fusion:

        Features from both branches are flattened and concatenated

        Three fully connected layers fuse the information and reconstruct the HR HSI spectrum

    Parameters:

        Follows the architecture described in Table 2 of the paper

        HSI branch: 20 filters per layer, kernel size 45×1

        MSI branch: 30 filters per layer, kernel size 10×10

        FC layers: 450 neurons in first two layers, output size equals HSI bands

    Input/Output:

        Input: LR HSI spectrum and corresponding HR MSI patch

        Output: Reconstructed HR HSI spectrum

The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how to create the model and process sample inputs. You can adjust the hyperparameters (hsi_bands, msi_bands, patch_size) based on your specific dataset.

Note that this is the core network architecture. For a complete implementation, you would also need to:

    Add data loading/preprocessing code

    Implement the training loop with the loss function described in the paper (Frobenius norm)

    Add evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM, SAM, etc.)
